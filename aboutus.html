            <p class="whometext jost">I am Zyanna Gail P. Deguito, the founder of Happy Heart, Happy Life, and a person
                with a
                goal in mind. Ever since when I was little, I always had that empathy and sympathy for the
                people around me. Though my life at home is chaotic, I will always not let that define who
                I am and drag me down.

            <p class="bgofustext1 jost">In the world full of sorrow and worries is a world that needs love, care, hope,
                and understanding. I grew up in a household where putting importance on mental health is considered
                overreacting. Whenever I would speak up about my feelings and worries, they would say “Napaka-OA mo
                naman. Naghahanap ka lang ng palusot.” or “Hoy, sabay-sabay ka masyado ng trend ng world.”, and they
                would make it worse by insulting me with hurtful words. Growing up in a household where I can’t let out
                what I feel feels suffocating and… depressing. But, I did not let that stop me, and instead, I wanted to
                fight for what is right, for what we need since the day we were born, especially after knowing that what
                I experienced, others also experienced.

            <p class="bgofustext2 jost">At school, I joined—out of the blue-a friend group that was very toxic and
                neglectful. At first, I
                really didn’t think much about their corrupted attitude and mindset, but subsequently there were signs
                of trauma and bad experiences. Instead of thinking bad and focusing on the toxicness about them, I dug
                deeper on “why”? After time, I realized that they were just broken souls, a kettle that needed that heat
                and pressure inside of them to stop.

            <p class="bgofustext3 jost"> One day, I made a way for us to open up, and indeed I was right, they just
                needed that love and care
                they needed. From months of unhealthy words and actions, to eventually warming up to each other, having
                that sense of purpose and goal in mind to be healthy and open, and also help those who were like us
                before. For that, we named our friend group, Skibigoals, skibidi from our favourite word that makes us
                motivated and happy, and goals as we have goals in mind everyday. After that, our friend group
                eventually became an advocacy group trying to let people know that their feelings are valid, how they
                should think healthy, and how they deserve love and care, too, regardless what gender, age, or status
                they have.
