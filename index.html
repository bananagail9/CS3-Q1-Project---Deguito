            <br>

            <p class="problem1 jost">
            Did you know that people around the world, including in the Philippines, experience mental health issues ranging
            from the smallest children to the “toughest” adults? In 2019, 970 million people were suffering from mental
            health issues (World Health Organization: WHO, 2022). In the Philippines in 2024, there was an estimation of
            11.3% to 11.6% of the Filipino population that live in to be suffering internally (Nd, 2024). In ages 10-19, 1
            in every 7 of them experiences a mental disorder, and 15% of working adults also experience the same (World
            Health Organization: WHO, 2024). From 2000 to 2021, rates of suicide in the Philippines have been increasing
            (World Bank Open Data, n.d.). Studies also show that everyday, approximately 70% of our thoughts are
            negative (Mo, 2025).</p>

            <p class="problem2 jost">
                Factors for these issues are not only inborn or genetic, but also things that we can experience in life, like
                abuse, trauma, neglect, social isolation or loneliness, discrimination, social disadvantage, stress, loss, or
                pressure that ledto the most common mental health disorders, depression, and anxiety (What Causes Mental Health Problems?,
                n.d.). Theseproblems are also increasing every year (Foulkes & Andrews, 2023). Harassment that is very common in the
                world, such asdomestic abuse, bullying, or sexual harassment, moreover, has an enormous effect on people’s mental health
                (Department of Veterans Affairs (jdt), 2022).</p>

            <br>

            <p class="solution jost">In the Philippines, there is a lot being done about it, such as the government making Republic Acts
                addressing the problem. Additionally, people are helping through organizations, and websites are trying to
                spread awareness and comfort.
                
                <br><br>

                R.A. 11036 focuses on human rights and focuses on mental health, as it is called the “Mental Health Act”, and
                R.A. 12080 focuses on the importance of students' and youth’s health, and due to that, they should prohibit
                any action that can damage so (REPUBLIC ACT NO. 12080 - Supreme Court ELibrary, n.d.; Republic Act No.
                11036, n.d.). Other Republic Acts like 10627 (Anti-Bullying), 9710 (Women Human Rights), 11313 (Safe Spaces
                Act), 7877 (Anti-Sexual Harassment), and many more help tolerate non-traumatic stressors that cause mental
                health issues (Republic Act No. 10627, n.d.; Republic Act No. 11313, n.d.; REPUBLIC ACT NO. 7877 - Supreme
                Court ELibrary, n.d.; Republic Act 9710: The Magna Carta of Women | Philippine Commission on Women, 2009).

                Organizations in the Philippines like MentalHealthPH and Philippine Mental Health 
                Association, Inc., alsosupport Mental Health (Philippine Mental Health Association, Inc., n.d.; MentalHealthPH, 
                2023). ThePhilippines, moreover, hosts events that raise awareness of mental health and launch movements for it.

                to spread mental health awareness, self-awareness, and loving and caring for yourself and others. Through
                this website, we aim to publicize and disseminate information about mental health, and provide ways to take
                care and have a deeper relationship with yourself and people that are good for you. Skibigoals, the heads of
                Happy Heart, Happy Life, and the Happy Hearts, the community and volunteers and supporters, are
                disseminating the information, hosting events, counselling sessions on a small scope in homes in
                communities, students in students, children in orphanages, and patients in hospitals, spreading the light

                warmth—understanding, love, care, hope, and joy, but over time this world covers that truth, and hides away
                the importance of it. Together, as family and friends, let us take away that cover—from darkness and
                coldness, to light and warmth.
